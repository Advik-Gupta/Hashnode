## Building a startup | Days 11 - 15

Hey guys,

I have been travelling these past 4 days, but I think I have made the most progress in terms of features I have added in this much time so far.

1) Connections âœ… <br>
2) App notifications âœ…<br>
3) Desktop notifications âœ…<br>
4) Make the remaining site responsive âœ…<br>

I finally finished doing the first major 'hard' part of the site. The functionality to add connections, send and accept requests etc. It took some time, but now it's done.

This is a pretty significant feature of the site, so it's a big relief to get it out of the way.

I hadn't planned to build out notifications this early into development, but it was one of those things where I just felt like making it, so I did. Now I have the whole infrastructure to make notifications ready and can easily keep incorporating this further in the app.

I also found one thing I could have done better in the app. But, I will have to change too many things to fix this, and I want to finish the MVP fast, so I keep it for V2.

That thing is ðŸ‘‡

Currently, I am storing 2 things on every user, Connections and Notifications, that I could move to their own collections instead of storing them as arrays on the user itself. 

So this would be something I would love to improve in V2 of the app. 
Up next I am going to build the chatting in the app. And once that's out of the way, we'll get to the real good stuff, or bad cause I can only imagine how much effort and time it's gonna take to build this.

This of course is the games themselves. I have no idea how the games and room functionally will work. I have it in my brain, but it's different when you start coding it out. So fingers crossed for when I get to it ðŸ¤ž
It can't be that bad after all. (don't quote me on that)

Well, for now, the app is doing great, progress is doing great, and it's going to be that way for at least some more time. Hopefully remains that way after as well ðŸ¤ž

Until next time ðŸ‘‹<br>
