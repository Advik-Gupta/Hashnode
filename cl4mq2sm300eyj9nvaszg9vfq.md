## My first month as a UI/UX Designer

Hey guys,

So I just started to learn UI/UX design this month, if you are interested or new to design here's my journey 👇

## What I have learned so far

I started of by learning some of the basics of design and moved straight into learning about sketching. This was my first experience with designing/drawing/sketching and it wasn't bad!
I never thought I could draw/sketch but what I made wasn't half as bad as I thought it was gonna be 😌😶

They are no masterpieces, but better than the stickmen I drew in art class 💪💪

Then I moved onto make some user flows. This was my first experience using Figma and it was so much fun! Figma is like having a superpower, you can visualize stuff without having to write any code, which is a completely new thing for me.

Using Figma for the first time was definitely the biggest thing I learned here, while making some nice user flows that lead me to Sitemaps which has been the most fun thing so far, cause they look really cool and professional and clean.

Next up I will be working on making wireframes, pretty excited for that 😃💪

## How am I learning?

I am learning using a Udemy course by Zero To Mastery Academy. I really like the instructor Daniel Schifano and the course is pretty nice overall, I would suggest it if you wanna learn design and Figma.

## Few things I have learnt as a beginner in design

1. Design unlike other things can be learnt by practice and putting in effort. I spent the longest time thinking you have to be naturally creative to be a designer but now I do feel like its a skill you can acquire by working towards it.

2. But being naturally creative is a great thing if you wanna become a designer. I am learning design cause it interests me and I just wanna make better looking websites, my main work will still remain web development. If you wanna be a full time designer a little natural creativity wont hurt, but definitely that doesn't mean you cannot learn design if you aren't creative naturally.

3. Figma is awesome 😁😁
