## Building a startup | Days 6 - 10

Hey guys,

I didn't code that much this week, but a lot did happen.

First of all one of my videos on Instagram crossed 1000 plays??!!?! It doesn't sound like much but it's insane for me. And so many of you lot have shown interest in my startup. Some people reached out to me to collaborate and work on it. That's so nice and thanks for showing interest in my startup and content. I'll try to be as consistent as I can be on all platforms and keep putting out stuff.

Secondly, I started to learn UI/UX design. I got a course from Zero To Mastery, the same company from whose course I learnt ReactJS. It's been great fun so far, I learnt to sketch and made some user flows in Figma. I have always had a problem with UI design as I can build websites but they look ugly. And as the design is essential to a website I decided to learn how to do it, so I can also improve it in the subsequent versions of GameSite.

Here's some things I made ðŸ‘‡

Speaking of GameSite, as I said I didn't code that much this week but I did make some progress. I completed the search for friend's functionality and profile pages. Now I can start with adding friends and chatting functionality. I'll link the video in which I discuss this more below. If you head on over to my channel leave a comment telling me you came from hashnode.

Thanks for reading Until next time ðŸ‘‹
