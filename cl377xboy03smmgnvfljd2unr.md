## Building a startup | Days 1 - 5

Hey guys,

It's been a pretty productive weekend, I did a lot of stuff.
Starting with the fact that I finally built up the courage to publish my first youtube video, which is crazy as I have been planning to do this for so long but never got to it. I'll link it down below if you wanna see it.

Making a first youtube video is a nerve-wracking experience but I just made it, literally. If I kept thinking about it too much then I would have never uploaded it, so I just sat down recorded the video and just uploaded it. And kept from watching it too many times before uploading, because seeing it every time just made me more scared to upload it. Also knowing that rarely anyone is gonna the video, is great cause then I don't have fear of 'what will people think of my videos'.

Also, I plan to release the pre-alpha of the app in some time to get the first response from actual users and work upon that.

Speaking of the app I made some decent progress, the basic user profiles are finished and I can start working on the user connections. Adding friends sending messages and all that good stuff. Then I'll get to the virtual trading system, the part I am most excited about, it's one of the more complex features on the site. I am pretty excited to build it.

Thanks for reading
Until next time ðŸ‘‹
