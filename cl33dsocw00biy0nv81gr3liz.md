## Building a startup - The Idea | Day 1 & 2

The idea is pretty simple. At the start of the lockdown, a digital version of the game Ludo blew up. It got me thinking do people still want to play old classic games they used to play in their childhood and early days, probably yes. We don't wanna go through the hassle of playing the physical version but we'll play it if the online version is available.

From here GameSite was born. I am basically collecting some of the classic games all of us love, like monopoly, ludo, cards and chess and putting it all together into one mega platform with tons of other functionality. You can make video, voice or chat rooms with your friends or stranger and play tons of games with a few other awesome features.

### Day 1 & 2

Till now I have made a decent amount of progress in the app.

User authentication âœ…

For the first version of the app, I plan on only having Google and custom accounts auth. In the later versions, I might add Twitter, Facebook and Phone auth as well.

The structure of the data in the database has proven to be a bit harder than expected. I keep thinking of more things to add and that keeps increasing the complexity.

But overall it's been pretty smooth till now, gonna work some on user profiles and plan out the structure of data I store so it doesn't bug me later. Then I gotta start working on the good stuff, most of these things I have never made before and will be trying for the first time.

Also, I have been working on making the UI look good from the start instead of leaving it for the end like I usually do in projects.

This is definitely the better way of making an app.

I'll try to document the whole process of building the app on my socials, maybe even make a video ðŸ˜ƒ

That's all the updates till now, thanks for reading =)
